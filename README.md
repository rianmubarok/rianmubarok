<h1>Hi, I'm Rian 👋</h1>
<p>
  <em>Web Developer • Exploring UI/UX, Motion, and App Development</em>
</p>

---

I'm passionate about turning ideas into useful tools through thoughtful design and efficient development workflows.  

### 🚀 Current Focus
- Building personal projects to sharpen fullstack skills  
- Learning best practices in API development and UI/UX design  
- Experimenting with small productivity tools and micro-apps  

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
I'm currently learning and building with tools that help me bring ideas to life —  
recently, I've been exploring things like React, Flask, and Vite for web development,  
alongside Git, MongoDB Atlas, and Figma to support the process.  
I’ve also built a mobile app using Dart with Firebase integration for backend support.
